Bike Route Recommender
======================

This directory contains the source code (Python 3) of a route recommender for
cyclists based on safety and comfort. It also contains sample data for the city
center of Zurich compiled under the frame of the project entitled: "On Cycling
Risk and Discomfort: Urban Safety Mapping and Bike Route Recommendations"

Execute the program by running in Jupyter the notebook -> main.ipynb
This will go on to request the paths to the data files necessary to set up the
route recommender, to then open a GUI for interactive route generation and data
collection.


Important files and folders:
---------------------------

code/					        Contains the files that form the program (see manual.pdf for details)
code/graph_files			Contains the street graphs weighted by risk and discomfort generated by the program
conf/					        Contains configuration files
conf/datacompilation.txt		        Configuration used in the last run of the program
conf/datacompilation_default.txt	  Configuration to be used as default by the program [to be implemented]
datasets/				      Contains sample datasets
datasets/bicyclerisk	Datasets for risk. The first line should be text and the subsequent lines should contain: Node ID, latitude,
                      longitude, altitude (m), and risk
datasets/streets			Datasets for street grids. The first line should be text and the subsequent lines should contain: Node ID, 
                      [latitude, longite, altitude(m)], [node IDs of the connected street grid points]
img/					        Contains the images used as background for the interactive map (.gif format)
userRoutes/				    The user defined routes generated using this program are stored in this folder
manual.pdf 				    [Coming soon] A description of how to use the bike route recommender and how to extend its functionality by adding 
                      custom datasets and cost and graph search functions
